# Our commitment to open source

At Scott Logic, we believe that open source offers immeasurable benefits and are keen to see increased adoption while tackling the sustainability challenges. We do this through:

 - **Consumption** - We have an open-source-first policy. If a viable open source project exists or one which we can readily adapt to meet our requirements, it is our first choice. We also take particular care when adopting open source components to ensure [we understand the risks these may present](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2022/03/24/the-dependencies-reckoning.html).
 - **Contribution** - We have a permissive open source policy and actively encourage our team to contribute to open source projects.
 - **Creation** - If we create a technology solution that we feel others would benefit from, we are committed to open sourcing it. You can see examples of our open source projects below.
 - **Partnering** - We are active members of the [Fintech Open Source Foundation](https://www.finos.org/) and [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and have partnered with various other organisations, such as [Bristol Pound](https://www.scottlogic.com/our-work/case-study-bristol-pound) and [J.P. Morgan](https://www.scottlogic.com/news/perspective-open-source-success-story), to collaborate on a great many open source projects and initiatives.
